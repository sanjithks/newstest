Al Habtoor Group in Dubai has announced the official launch of the largest residential building in the world. It will be constructed on the most desirable site on Sheikh Zayed Road, on the banks of the Dubai Water Canal, overlooking the Burj Khalifa in the Business Bay neighborhood, and close to the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).

The new skyscraper, a multibillion-dirham construction with ultra-luxurious residential amenities, will be constructed in Al Habtoor City. It will be one of the largest and most innovative sustainable landmark structures in the world, as per **Khalaf Al Habtoor**, founding chairman of Al Habtoor Group.

**The Habtoor Tower**, a multibillion-dirham construction, will contain **1,701 keys** across a built-up area of **3,517,313 square feet **and **81 floors** above ground and is expected to be completed within 36 months.

Al Habtoor Group stated that the structure would be constructed utilizing cutting-edge, inventive, and selected construction techniques, drawing on decades of knowledge gained from the Burj Al Arab, Terminals 1 and 3 of the Dubai International Airport, the Officers' Club in Abu Dhabi, and several other projects.
